Swagger is a fantastic tool to help develope API. It automatically generate a page to show the response. Moreover, it generates the class object for different lunguages so when you call the API you can use the Object instead of calling it yourself. This is great. Swagger does not have a Javascript codegen, but with a third-party plugin we can do that. It is called ["swagger-js-codegen"][codegen]. It is brillient, however, with the little help of its document, you would easily get lost. In this article, I will tell you how to do that.
